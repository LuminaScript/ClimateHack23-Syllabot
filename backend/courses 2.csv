MGMT0001,Principles of Management,"Organizations emerge because individuals can't (or don't want to) accomplish their goals alone. Management is the art and science of helping individuals achieve their goals together. Managers in an organization determine where their organization is going and how it gets there. More formally, managers formulate strategies and implement those strategies. This 0.5 credit unit course provides a framework for understanding the opportunities and challenges involved in formulating and implementing strategies. We examine multiple aspects of how managers address their environments, strategy, structure, culture, tasks, people, and outputs, and how managerial decisions made in these various domains interrelate. The course will help you begin to understand and analyze how managers can formulate and implement strategies effectively. Please note that this 0.5 CU course does not fulfil the Wharton MGMT 1010 requirement",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT0001,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT0004,"Work, Power, and Inequal","From the immigrant shirtwaist sewers' strike of 1909 to the 2021 union declaration by engineers Google, MGMT004 examines imbalances of power in the workplace and responses to perceived abuses of employer power. We investigate, via an exploration of government regulations and an examination of movements like #MeToo, how government and firm-level human capital policies shape workforce inequalities of race and gender. Throughout the course, we compare the United States with other countries to assess how national institutions influence both productivity and profitability (for firms) and fairness and stability (for workers).",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT0004,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT 1010,Intro To Management,"We all spend much of our lives in organizations. Most of us are born in organizations, educated in organizations, and work in organizations. Organizations emerge because individuals can't (or don't want to) accomplish their goals alone. Management is the art and science of helping individuals achieve their goals together. Managers in an organization determine where their organization is going and how it gets there. More formally, managers formulate strategies and implement those strategies. This course provides a framework for understanding the opportunities and challenges involved in formulating and implementing strategies by taking a ""system"" view of organizations,which means that we examine multiple aspects of how managers address their environments, strategy, structure, culture, tasks, people, and outputs, and how managerial decisions made in these various domains interrelate. The course will help you to understand and analyze how managers can formulate and implement strategies effectively. It will be particularly valuable if you are interested in management consulting, investment analysis, or entrepreneurship - but it will help you to better understand and be a more effective contributor to any organizations you join, whether they are large, established firms or startups. This course must be taken for a grade.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT1010,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT1110,Multinational Management,"Most successful firms go global in some way; why do they go global, and how do they navigate across international borders? This is the question at the core of multinational management. In this course, you will learn about topics such as how firms choose where and how to invest abroad, how shifts in the political economy landscape affect firm strategy, and how firms respond to restrictions on the movement of both physical and human capital across borders. The class utilizes economics and global strategy frameworks to provide students with an understanding of how to formulate multinational firm strategy. Fulfills the Global Economy, Business, and Society requirement. This course has a mandatory attendance policy.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT1110,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT1170,Glob Grwth of Emerg Firm,"Emerging firms are a critical element of economic growth, and a key source of gains in innovation and social welfare. This course is designed to depart from the U.S.-centric conversation on startups - with its outsized focus on Silicon Valley - and train a critical eye on some of the unique innovations emerging from new regional hotspots across the globe, with a particular focus on developing and emerging economies. We will discuss the challenges faced by founders in different global contexts, the components of a robust institutional ecosystem, and the ways in which creative solutions may flourish in response to local problems. Along the way, students will gain a virtual view into global startup communities, and personalized insights from firm founders operating around the world - from Bogota to Nairobi to Jakarta. The course will be structured in three primary parts. The first and longest section will discuss the Key Challenges for emerging firm growth across the globe, such as access to talent and resources, political risk, and legal institutions. The second section will highlight particularly active areas of Context-Driven Innovation that are thriving in various regions, such as financial technology, mobile health products, and clean energy. The final section will train Regional Spotlights on different geographic areas in turn, so that we may focus on the challenges and opportunities specific to various parts of the world.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT1170,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2050,Multinatl Corp Strateg,"This course focuses on the creation of competitive advantage in the multinational firm. It examines the nature of global competition by exploring the characteristics of global versus non-global industries and firms. We also explore different types of international strategy and structure and examine the specific challenges of managing in multiple countries and markets. Finally, we consider the strategic allocation of resources along the value chain and the role of strategic alliances as a crucial element of an effective global strategy.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2050,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2080,Mnging Glob & Anti-Glob,"Managing Globalization and Anti-Globalization provides students with a solid foundation in the economic history of globalization and anti-globalization, the institutions that manage the global economy, and the current challenges these institutions are facing. Students in this class will develop their own worldview about the powerful forces shaping today's international political economy and build a solid foundation for understanding the future of organizational strategy. The first half of the course focuses on the historical trajectory of globalization and learning about the institutions that seek to manage it. The second half of the course explores how institutions manage present-day global governance challenges ranging from global migration, the rise of populist anti-globalization movements, the collapse of communism, and global inequality, to disruptive technologies such as bitcoin. Format: Lectures and discussion structured to encourage maximum student participation. Requirements: midterm and final exam, a final course paper of 10-20 pages and short reaction papers dealing with the readings for the week. Supplemental activities include map quizzes, small group projects, and current events analysis.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2080,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2090,Pol & Soc Environ of Mm,"The share of executives, board members, and investment managers who consider climate risk, racial justice and other ESG issues as well as stakeholder’s opinions of the firm to be material to their business decisions has risen dramatically. If this business case for engagement with stakeholders on ESG issues can be demonstrated to mainstream investors, pools of capital can be mobilized to harness grand societal challenges. However, executives, board members, and investment managers are actually growing less confident in the ESG data available to guide capital allocations and strategic decisions. ESG scores have been demonstrated to be unreliable, incomplete and biased and often lean on outdated and/or incomplete information obtained through voluntary unaudited disclosure. This course provides students the latest tools to assess and map stakeholder opinions as well as integrate them into financial valuation. It also offers behavioral skills critical for stakeholder engagement including trust building, strategic communications and shaping organizational culture. In short, it prepares students to engage in Corporate Diplomacy (i.e., to influence external stakeholders’ opinions of the acceptability of a company’s operations at a moment in time and to convince internal stakeholders to adapt their behaviors, systems and outputs` when necessary to support an organizational mission).",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2090,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2110,Competitive Strategy,"This is an advanced course in competitive strategy. The course will apply the tools of industrial organization economics and game theory to examine the strategic decisions that managers make. We will examine those decisions concerning pricing, capacity investment, advertising, new product introductions, and research and development. Emphasis will be placed on the strategic interaction among rival sellers. In particular we will look at the various methods of entry deterrence and strategic commitment. The course will attempt to integrate traditional economic models with case study materials. In addition to prerequisites, some knowledge of microeconomics is suggested. The course will be discussion oriented and based largely on case materials and mini-lectures.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2110,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2120,Social Entrepreneurship,"This is a course on creating a business to attack a social problem and thereby accomplish both social impact and financial sustainability. For this course, social entrepreneurship is defined as entrepreneurship used to profitably confront social problems. This definition therefore views social entrepreneurship as a distinct alternative to public sector initiatives. The basic thesis is that many social problems, if looked at through an entrepreneurial lens, create opportunity for someone to launch a venture that generates profits by alleviating that social problem. This sets in motion a virtuous cycle - the entrepreneur is incented to generate more profits and in so doing, the more the profits made, the more the problem is alleviated. Even if it is not possible to eventually create a profit-making enterprise, the process of striving to do so can lead to a resource-lean not-for-profit entity. Creating a profitable social entrepreneurship venture is by no means a simple challenge. Cross-listed with MGMT 812.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2120,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2130,Entrep Through Acquis,"The objective of this course is to study the process of entrepreneurship through the acquisition of existing operating businesses. We will study this process through a series of lectures, assigned readings, case studies, and a final project which will follow the acquisition process. Freshmen require instructor's permission.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2130,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2140,Tech & Innov Strategy,"The course is designed to meet the needs of future managers, entrepreneurs, consultants and investors who must analyze and develop business strategies in technology-based industries. The emphasis is on learning conceptual models and frameworks to help navigate the complexity and dynamism in such industries. This is not a course in new product development or in using information technology to improve business processes and offerings. We will take a perspective of both established and emerging firms competing through technological innovations, and study the key strategic drivers of value creation and appropriation in the context of business ecosystems. There is definitely an overlap in content with other courses in intermediate microeconomics, or managerial economics. Nevertheless, the treatment is sufficiently distinctive to make it complementary to those other treatments for a student who is particularly interested in economic change, or is otherwise interested in acquiring a broader view of economics.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2140,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2230 ,Business Strategy,"This course encourages students to analyze the problems of managing the total enterprise in the domestic and international setting. The focus is on the competitive strategy of the firm, examining issues central to its long- and short-term competitive position. Students act in the roles of key decision-makers or their advisors and solve problems related to the development or maintenance of the competitive advantage of the firm in a given market. The first module of the course develops an understanding of key strategic frameworks using theoretical readings and case-based discussions. Students will learn concepts and tools for analyzing the competitive environment, strategic position and firm-specific capabilities in order to understand the sources of a firm's competitive advantage. In addition, students will address corporate strategy issues such as the economic logic and administrative challenges associated with diversification choices about horizontal and vertical integration. The second module will be conducted as a multi-session, computer-based simulation in which students will have the opportunity to apply the concepts and tools from module 1 to make strategic decisions. The goal of the course is for students to develop an analytical tool kit for understanding strategic issues and to enrich their appreciation for the thought processes essential to incisive strategic analysis. This course offers students the opportunity to develop a general management perspective by combining their knowledge of specific functional areas with an appreciation for the requirements posed by the need to integrate all functions into a coherent whole. Students will develop skills in structuring and solving complex business problems. In addition to prerequisites, enrollment is limited to seniors and juniors that have completed introductory courses in finance, marketing, and accounting.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2230,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2240,Leading Diversity in Org,"People in the workplace are constantly interacting with peers, managers, and customers with very different backgrounds and experiences. When harnessed effectively, these differences can be the catalyst for creative breakthroughs and the pathway to team and organizational learning and effectiveness; but when misunderstood, these differences can challenge employees' values, performance, workplace relationships, and team effectiveness. This course is designed to help students navigate diverse organizational settings more effectively and improve their ability to work within and lead diverse teams and organizations. It also offers students the opportunity to develop their critical thinking on topics such as identity, relationships across difference, discrimination and bias, equality, and equity in organizations and society and how they relate to organizational issues of power, privilege, opportunity, inclusion,creativity and innovation and organizational effectiveness. Class sessions will be experiential and discussion-based. Readings, self-reflection, guest speakers from organizations, case studies and a final project will also be emphasized. By the end of this course, you should be able to: 1)Evaluate the aspects of yo ur identity and personal experiences that shape how you interact and engage with others and how they interact and engage with you in organizations 2)Explain how issues of power, privilege, discrimination, bias, equality, and equity influence opportunity and effectiveness in organizations 3)Propose ways to make relationships across difference in organizations more effective 4)Describe current perspectives on the relationships among diversity, inclusion, creativity, and innovation in organizations 5)Analyze a company's current approach to leading diversity and use content from this course to propose ways to enhance learning and effectiveness in that company.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2240,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2250,Value Creation & Val Cap,"This course examines how the kind of firms in which most Wharton students will spend the next stage of their careers came to be as they are today. At a superficial level, the course's objectives are descriptive and narrative. But history, considered thoughtfully and critically, is never just description and a narrative and the course's deeper purpose is to give students some idea of how to think about the future evolution of firms and industries. In this the course is as much an applied strategy course as it is a historical survey. The course considers the development of the business enterprise as an economic institution. It also covers the evolution of competition and strategy, marketing institutions, some aspects of the history of operations management, and corporate finance. Issues arising in these different management disciplines are considered in part for the purpose of showing off their interrelationships. Questions of how value can be created and captured at the enterprise level form the core of the perspective. The course's focus is on American developments, since many of the innovations took place here, but there is scope for comparison with Japan and the leading European economies if there is student interest. Chronologically the course runs from Franklin's days through the early twenty-first century. The individual classes proceed through discussion of actual business decisions and performance in a series of challenging and otherwise interesting moments in the evolution of the American business environment. The materials are unusual for the Wharton School--they are not just often case-like but wherever possible draw on documents contemporary to the decisions such as correspondence, internal memoranda, minutes of meetings, old newspaper and magazine stories, and eyewitness accounts. The objective in this is to give students as minimally mediated access as is feasible to what the embedded actors knew and thought. The materials require thoughtful preparation. Weekly short writing assignments during the first twelve weeks of the term develop students' skill in turning such preparation into crisp analytical prose. (This will be valuable to most ex-students in the early phases of their post-Wharton careers.) The course as a process is much more focused on the students than many and the most productive experience of it demands that the students both engage with the materials when they prepare and then take an active role in the class discussion. The largest single element in the grading is a substantial term paper on a topic agreeable to both the student and the instructor. (To everyone's surprise, the lack of easy access",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2250,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2290,Intel Property Strategy,"Announcing the first iPhone at Macworld 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs famously boasted: ""And boy, have we patented it!"" How, and to what extent, do patents and intellectual property really provide competitive advantage for innovative technology companies? What makes an IP asset strategically powerful? How do patents impact, and even drive, major corporate decisions including M&A, venture funding and exits, and entry into new markets? In this course, students will learn to critically analyze and answer these questions, gaining insights they can leverage in their future roles as innovation industry executives, entrepreneurs, strategist and investors. The course includes three major units. In Unit 1, Patents and Innovation Value, we examine closely the relationship between competitive advantage, value proposition, and intellectual property (particularly patents). We will apply our understanding of that relationship to critique and sharpen patent strategy to protect examples of cutting-edge technologies. In Unit 2, Patent Leverage and the Corporate Playbook, we study theory and examples of how intellectual property leverage strategically informs corporate transactions and decisions, for established companies as well as for start-ups. In unit 3, Limits and Alternatives to Patents, we confront the recent legal trend toward reigning in the power and scope of patents. We also consider the growing importance of data as a proprietary technology asset, and discuss options for adapting intellectual property strategy appropriately. Throughout, students will learn and practice applying the concepts we learn to decision-making in examples based on innovative real-world technologies and businesses.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2290,University of Pennsylvania

MGMT2410,Knowledge For Soc Impact,"Inequality. Poverty. Racism. Climate change. COVID. Violence. Crime. And so much more. The list of societal challenges in the United States and around the globe is daunting. Like many other students, you may hope to make a positive difference in the world. But, where and how? This course is designed to help you begin to answer this question. We will meet with for-profit and nonprofit leaders working to make a difference, drawing lessons from their successes, failures, evolution, and resilience. We will read and discuss rigorous social science research that ensures that we move from hunches to facts, from simplistic and ineffective solutions to systems knowledge. We will investigate impact measurement strategies, asking “What is feasible and beneficial to monitor and measure, and why?” And, we will take a deep dive into two of the complex societal challenges facing the US States today: (1) barriers to college access, completion, and post-college employment; and (2) barriers to employment following incarceration.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2410,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2420,Corp. Governance Exec,"This course examines the relationships between corporate managers, the boards of directors charged with overseeing them, and investors. We'll review the responsibilities of the board, including financial statement approval, CEO performance assessment, executive compensation, and succession planning. While boards are legally bound to represent the interests of equity investors, in the course of carrying out this role they are often called on to respond to the needs of numerous other stakeholders, including customers, employees, government and society at large. With global brands at risk and mistakes instantly transmitted via Internet and social media, the reputational stakes are very high. The course is a combination of lecture, guest lecture, discussion, case analysis, and in-class research workshops. We will review some of the theory underlying modern governance practice, drawing from theories and evidence provided by research across diverse fields, including finance, sociology, and organization and management theory. We'll study specific situations where boards and management teams faced governance challenges, and assess the strategies used to deal with them. Finally, we'll examine the ways in which governance arrangements and external stakeholder involvement in governance affects corporate social behavior and global citizenship.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2420,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2430,Wrk & Tech:Choices & Out,"That technology affects work is a commonplace - but we accept technology’s impact too readily as inevitable and unchangeable. This 0.5 CU course challenges the mindset of technological determinism and explores what choice points are available to managers implementing new technologies as well as the engineers who design them. • Module 1: “Technology and Its Impact on Jobs and Skills” considers which technologies deserve the characterization of “revolutionary” due to their capacity to change entire organizations – and even societies — vs. those that only substitute narrowly for past technologies. We’ll examine past anxieties related to automation and evaluate the extent to which the “worst-case” scenarios about employment loss have or have not come to pass – and evaluate claims of “this time it’s different”. • Module 2: “Intelligent Technologies: How Will They Affect Work and Organizations?” explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing core “managing people” activities (e.g., hiring and performance appraisal) – plus shifting the locus of management away from human bosses and into algorithms. We’ll examine controversies around “gig work”, i.e., the positives of worker schedule flexibility vs. the negatives of algorithmic control. We’ll also consider the metaverse and its potential for unleashing human creativity and fostering richer and more nuanced virtual communication - as well as providing organizations with new ways to monitor and control. • Module 3: “Technology and Policy” examines three policy issues. First, how can we inject more ethical criteria into the development of artificial intelligence and algorithms affecting work? Second, what are the pros and cons of “universal basic income”, whose premise is that technological change will soon lead to an unprecedented amount of job elimination? Third, how does “technology make us dumber”? How can we avoid the obsolescence of critical human skills? Take this course to be ready to manage the strategic and analytic issues involving the design and implementation of technology at work - and for a preview of your own future work life. Requirements include: class participation; in-class quizzes; interviewing someone you know to ask how technology has affected their work life; and the “In Hindsight” group assignment looking back on past scares about a particular technology’s impact on work - and what actually happened.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2430,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2480,How To Be the Boss ,"Despite the press accounts about the ""gig"" economy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates that about 92 percent of the people working in the US are employees who are supervised by someone. That figure has remained roughly the same for decades. The term ""supervisor"" is sometimes used for the first-level of supervision in an organization, but in fact that role - and indeed the title ? goes all the way up to the very top of any employer organization. Even CEO's are the supervisor of their direct reports. When people talk about their ""boss,"" they almost always are referring to the person who supervises them. Stepping into a supervisor position is challenging, exceptionally so the first time. Thattime comes relatively soon for Wharton grads. Undergrads pursuing consulting jobs typically find themselves supervising new hires by their third year, those working for corporations find themselves in those roles even sooner. Roughly three-quarters of our MBA students report that they had been required to supervise subordinates after college and before arriving here. In this class, we examine the role of the supervisor and the unique tasks associated with performing that role. We pay special attention to the unique challenges of taking on that role for the first time.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2480,University of Pennsylvania

The course is motivated by rapid increases in both the supply of and demand for private equity over the past two decades. The topic is addressed from two distinct perspectives: issues that relate to the demand for private equity and venture capital (the entrepreneur's perspective) on the one hand, and issues that relate to the supply of capital (the investor's perspective) on the other. As well, we will address management issues that relate to how the VC and the entrepreneur work together once an investment has been made, compensation issues, and governance issues in the privately held venture capital backed company.

In this course we explore this sector using a combination of research papers, press coverage, and practitioner involvement. Each class session will be devoted to discussion of a single research article, during which we will be joined via state-of-the-art videoconferencing by a Wharton alum from the tech sector whose expertise is relevant to the paper topic. Therefore, the learning objectives half-credit course are to: 1) understand the managerial, organizational, and regional institutions that characterize the tech sector, with particular emphasis on the case of Silicon Valley 2)Bridge research and practice by critical analysis of academic research papers in conjunction with practitioner input 3) Forge connections with tech sector practitioners, particularly with our west coast alumni base.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2650,University of Pennsylvania

The goals and outcomes of technology entrepreneurship vary as much as the innovations that inspire them. MGMT 267 will take you through the questions that entrepreneurs should address as they go from a technology innovation idea to founding and funding a tech startup. The course will appeal to individuals who have a desire to become technology entrepreneurs at some stage of their career, as well as others interested in the startup ecosystem such as investors, early employees, other professional service providers, etc. Through a combination of individual and team work, you will examine what is different when technology is at the core of an entrepreneurial opportunity and how to move a technology-based venture forward.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2670,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2720,Power & Pol in Organiz,"""If you want to test a (person's) character, give (him/her) power."" These famous words articulate one of the many tensions of exercising power. Regardless of whether you have an appetite for power or disdain it, power and politics are likely to play an important role in your career. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to concepts that are useful for understanding, analyzing, and developing your political skill. But beyond discovering ways to extend your own power in organizations, we will also uncover lessons about ways in which power and politics can blind you, and how to navigate situations in which you are up against powerful people. Using a range of scholarly articles, cases, exercises, assessments and simulations, we will extract a variety of lessons relevant to your role in organizations. Topics include diagnosing power in organizations, building coalitions, change management, understanding networks, coping with intolerable bosses and incivility, and downsizing. Students will be expected to engage in field research for their coursework and final paper, and the course requires that students submit assignments for almost every class session. Organizations are inherently political arenas that require social astuteness, and an understanding of the ""rules of the game."" This course is designed for students aiming to develop their leadership, general management and career skills through a better understanding of power and politics, and relates to other courses on these topics in the Management department.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2720,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2750 ,Comparative Capitalism,"While we often debate capitalism as a system, the nature of capitalist economies differ from country to country and rarely match up to the ideal. Why do these differences arise? Is there a pure form of capitalism? What is the nature of capitalism in advanced and emerging economies? Why are capitalist economies often embedded in other social systems? Why do some economies grow faster than others? How do international institutions and interdependencies affect national capitalist institutions? How are the strategies of multinational corporations (MNCs) influenced by their country of origin? And how is the nature of capitalism changing today? This course provides insight into these questions as it explores the nature of capitalism around the world, with specific reference to Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, China, Hungary, Nigeria, South Africa, Singapore, Israel, Argentina, and the advanced OECD countries. Students will leave this class with understanding key differences in how capitalist economies are organized and competition over the future of the world economy.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2750,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2760,Cultiv Judgment Skills.,"This course will explore the diverse ways in which scholars and practitioners have defined ""good judgment."" And it will introduce students to practical tools for assessing and improving judgment, with special emphasis on probabilistic reasoning. Students will have the opportunity both to fine-tune their personal judgment skills as well as to master and then weave together insights from several bodies of scientific knowledge, including frequentist and Bayesian statistics, psychological work on judgment and choice, group dynamics, organizational behavior and political science (key concepts discussed in Tetlock's (2015) book ""Superforecasting""). We will focus on bottom-line accuracy in sizing up real world problems. Class work will be primarily exercises, including working as an individual and in teams. You will have opportunities to forecast on a wide range of political, business, and macro-economic questions, which we will use as feedback tools to help you calibrate your judgment. Assessments include a weekly concept test and a final group presentation aimed to help you improve your judgment. The goal is to launch you on the lifelong process of learning how much trust you should place in your judgments of trustworthiness.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2760,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2870,Global Mgmt Digital Business,"Digital businesses enable users to communicate, interact, share, and engage in transactions. They enable individuals to shop, work, play, and learn, and they offer companies new ways of organizing their value chains, reaching customers, collecting and analyzing information, and creating value. This half-semester, 0.5-cu class deals with the international expansion of businesses through the use of digital technologies. The focus is on the tension between the eminent scalability facilitated by digital technologies and the ruggedness of the international landscape, shaped as it is by demographics, consumer preferences, culture, regulatory structures, and network effects operating at the local, national, regional, and global levels. The class covers both companies launched as digital businesses and traditional companies undergoing a digital transformation. Topics include industry dynamics, the impact of network effects, the sequence of foreign market entry, regulatory risk, strategic interaction, and global versus local strategies for both new digital businesses and established firms undergoing digital transformation. While there are no specific requirements, knowledge of the fundamental concepts of competitive strategy and global strategy is essential to follow this class. Students will learn through interactive class discussions, team-based exercises, and self-made short videos to pitch novel new ideas about digital businesses.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2870,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2880,Mnging & Compet in China,"The business environment in China is characterized by both uncertainty and complexity. On the one hand, it is changing fast; on the other hand, it is influenced by deep-rooted political, economic, and cultural forces that exhibit tremendous inertia. This course will help students--as potential managers, entrepreneurs, and investors--gain the knoweledge and analytical skills necessary to compete effectively in China. We will discuss various types of firms in the Chinese economy--from large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to newly minted Internet giants, from prominent multinational companies (MNCs) to virtually anonymous local suppliers--and the unique institutions in which these firms operate. Such discussions will also help managers whose firms compete or collaborate with Chinese firms on the global stage. We will use a combination of lectures, cases, debates, and role play in class. You will also have the opportunity to apply your learning to real business scenarios.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2880,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2910,Negotiations,"This course examines the art and science of negotiation, with additional emphasis on conflict resolution. Students will engage in a number of simulated negotiations ranging from simple one-issue transactions to multi-party joint ventures. Through these exercises and associated readings, students explore the basic theoretical models of bargaining and have an opportunity to test and improve their negotiation skills.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2910,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2920, Advanced Negotiation,"This course is designed to teach negotiation principles and to enable students to develop their negotiation skills. This course assumes familiarity with the basic negotiation concepts covered in the prerequisite for this course: Negotiations. In this course, we extend the study and practice of negotiations and we develop a deeper understanding for how specific aspects of the negotiation process (e.g., emotions, deadlines, trust violations) impact outcomes. Through course lectures, readings, and case exercises, students will develop a rich framework for thinking about the negotiation process and acquire tools for guiding the negotiation process.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2920,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2930 ,People Analytics,"This course examines the use of data to understand and improve how people are managed in organizations. People really are organizations' most important asset, providing the critical link in converting strategy and capital into value. Yet throughout most of our history, most organizations have relied on long-standing traditions, hear-say, political expedience, prejudice and gut instinct to make decisions about how those people should be managed. Recent years have seen a growing movement to bring more science to how we manage people. In some cases, that means ensuring that whatever practices and approaches we adopt are backed up by solid evidence as to their effectiveness. Often, organizations will seek to go further, analyzing their own data to identify problems and learn what is working and what is not in their own context. This course applies the insights of the people analytics movement to help students become better managers and more critical analysts within their organizations. The course aims to develop students in three specific ways. First, it will provide students with an up-to-the-minute grounding in current evidence about managing people, providing a knowledge base that can ensure that their future management is guided by best practices. Second, we will develop the skills and understanding necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of evidence on people management, allowing them to make the most of the analysis available to them as they make people decisions. Third, we will provide guidance and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing students to gather data of their own, and making them more skilled analysts. We will pursue these goals through a mixture of lecture, case discussion, and hands on exploration of a variety of data sets.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2930,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT2940,Understanding Careers,"he class will examine a variety of aspects of careers. The first few sessions explore the basic building blocks of the career, outlining our knowledge on the different orientations that individuals take to their careers, how approaches to the career change as people get older, and how different kinds of job moves within and across firms advance careers. We will complement academic research by also hearing from an experienced executive who can talk about the issues that she dealt with as her career unfolded, and how she approached major decisions. The second part of the course explores in more detail the social resources that affect careers. Much research has examined how the structure of social networks affect success in the workplace and access to job. We will review this evidence with an eye to understanding how effective relationships can be developed. We will also examine some of the most critical relationships for shaping careers - those involving mentors and sponsors. The third section of the course then examines a number of the most important and difficult issues affecting modern careers. We explore one of the most difficult transitions that forms part of many careers, moving into management from an individual contributor role. We will also explore important social psychological conditions and strategies that allow individuals to persist and succeed in their career pursuit, especially in the face of obstacles, such as career setbacks and employer rejections. We then turn to issues of gender and careers. There is much evidence on the particular challenges that have faced women managers and executives in moving up the corporate ladder. We examine that evidence and discuss possible responses by managers and by organizations. We also discuss how individuals and organizations can manage the challenges of balancing work and personal life throughout the career.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT2940,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT3010,Tmwrk & Intrper Influenc,"Organizations emerge because individuals cannot (or do not want to) accomplish their goals alone. Likewise, employees pursue projects in teams and other small units because there is strength in numbers. For example, over 80% of Fortune 1,000 companies use teams to accomplish their goals. As such, collaboration - in relationships and in teams - is the building block of organizational effectiveness. In addition, most of your work each day will occur in a social context, and it will require you to influence others, and be influenced by, others. In this course we will use the latest evidence from the science of organizations to understand key tactics that can help you work more effectively with others and better influence and lead them as you strive to attain shared goals. We will cover topics such as team coordination, team decision making, interpersonal influence, leader effectiveness, and ethics. This course is the third module of the four-module set that comprises the Wharton Leadership Journey. MGMT 3010 assumes exposure to MGMT 1010 content. As of Fall 2022 MGMT 1010 will become a formal prerequisite for the class.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT3010,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT3530 ,Wharton Field Challenge,"Do you want to make a real difference in the lives of a student? Do you want to set kids on a path to becoming financially literate?

We partner with various public schools around the West Philadelphia area and teach concepts integral to financial literacy. We teach a wide range of grades from middle school to high school, and work with students to help them learn how to be financially responsible. In addition to teaching in neighboring high schools, we also have group class meetings run by Professor Keith Weigelt on Mondays from 7:00 PM-8:30 PM.

MGMT3880,Venture Acceleration Lab,"This Lab emphasizes experiential learning in evaluating and contributing to “live” startup ventures. The goal of the Lab is to accelerate the development of ventures by providing a structured curricular setting in which mentors with industry expertise as operators and investors provide guidance to full-time venture founders. Undergraduate and MBA students learn through witnessing these interactions and through helping ventures structure their value creation and capture strategies. The latter is facilitated via instructor-led classes on focused venture development concepts. This unique Lab therefore brings together communities which rarely mix: startup founders, enrolled students as potential venture “joiners” and consultants, venture mentors, and technical/academic specialists.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT3880,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT3980,Managing and Motivating,"People are the most valuable asset of any business, but they are also the most unpredictable, and the most difficult, asset to manage. And although managing people well is critical to the health of any organization, most managers don't get the training they need to make good management decisions. Now, award-winning authors and renowned management Professors Mike Useem and Peter Cappelli of the Wharton School have designed this course to introduce you to the key elements of managing people. Based on their popular course at Wharton, this course will teach you how to motivate individual performance and design reward systems, how to design jobs and organize work for high performance, how to make good and timely management decisions, and how to design and change the your organization's architecture. By the end of this course, you'll have developed the skills you need to start motivating, organizing, and rewarding people in your organization so that you can thrive as a business and as a social organization. This course can also only be applied towards unrestricted electives at the undergraduate level.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT3980,University of Pennsylvania
MGMT4010,Growing Social Impact,"This course seeks to address a gap at the core of contemporary entrepreneurship: despite a growing desire to pursue prosocial goals and affect positive change in the world, most founders have little understanding of how to measure, manage, and scale their impact. This creates the risk that financial goals will play an outsized role in decision-making, particularly as the venture scales, leading founders to drift away from social impact aims - or to pursue goals that fail to deliver on their intended impacts. MGMT 401 fulfils the Wharton capstone requirement with a hands-on approach to addressing these issues. Students will work hand-in-hand with the founding teams of pre-selected startups from the Wharton venture community to develop a strategy for measuring social impact, and ensuring fidelity to social goals as the venture goes to market and begins to scale. Projects will be group-based, and will ask students to integrate learnings on social enterprise, impact measurement, and impact investing, with prior coursework on entrepreneurship, social impact, business ethics, leadership, team dynamics, and venture finance. Students will leave the class with a deeper appreciation of the potential for business to be a force for good in the world, and the difficulties that this can pose during the founding and growth stages of a new business. The class will be of value to students who are interested in creating socially impactful businesses, as well as to those who want to work in the ecosystem that supports such ventures (e.g., consulting, or impact investing).",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT4010,University of Pennsylvania

LGST2300 ,Social Impact & Resp,"What role can business play in helping to meet global societal needs, whether it involves the environment, improving health, expanding education or eradicating poverty? Is there any responsibility on the part of business to help meet those needs? What are models of successful business engagement in this area? How should success be measured? Are there limits to what businesses can and should do, and what institutional changes will enable businesses and entrepreneurs to better succeed? This survey course provides students the opportunity to engage in the critical analysis of these and other questions that lie at the foundation of social impact and responsibility as an area of study. The course involves case studies, conceptual issues, and talks by practitioners.

The course is required for the secondary concentration in Social Impact and Responsibility",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=LGST2300,University of Pennsylvania
LGST2410 ,Business Enterprise,"What is a business firm? How did various forms of business, including the corporation, arise historically? How do contemporary economic and financial theories explain how business firms evolve, grow, and die? What are the legal underpinnings of the forms of business enterprise, ranging from sole proprietorships to partnerships to family-owned enterprises to multinational corporate groups? How do business firms relate to politics and government, as well as religion? What about the environment? This interdisciplinary course offers an introduction to pursuing answers to these questions. Students will gain perspective on the nature of business enterprises from different points of view that will be useful in further research, as well as having practical application. Ubiquitous economic concepts such as agency costs, principal-agent relationships, transaction costs, and influence costs will be studied. Different legal structures of firms will also be introduced, including new hybrid organizations such as benefit corporations, which seek to meld non-profit and profit objectives. In the course, we will read high-profile U.S. Supreme Court cases such as Citizens United and Hobby Lobby and debate appropriate boundaries (or not) between business and politics, as well as business and religion. Business ethics and the nature of any social responsibilities owed by business and business people will be topics too.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=LGST2410,University of Pennsylvania
LGST2420 ,"Big Data, Big Resp","Significant technologies always have unintended consequences, and their effects are never neutral. A World of ubiquitous data, subject to ever more sophisticated collection, aggregation, and analysis, creates massive opportunities for both financial gain and social good. It also creates dangers in areas such as privacy, security, discrimination, exploitation, and inequality, as well as simple hubris about the effectiveness of management by algorithm. Firms that anticipate the risks of these new practices will be best positioned to avoid missteps. This course introduces students to the legal, policy, and ethical dimensions of big data, predictive analytics, and related techniques. It then examines responses-both private and governmental-that may be employed to address these concerns.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=LGST2420,University of Pennsylvania
LGST2430 , Other People's Money,"We learn in introductory economics courses that money is fungible: that is, one dollar is as good as the next. Indeed, using money as a ""medium of exchange"" is one of its defining characteristics. But what happens when we take a big pile of money and put it in different buckets. On one bucket we might write ""hedge fund""; on another, ""central bank""; on still another, ""payday lender."" Then money starts to change in ways defined by law, history, ethics, and politics. This course will take you on a tour of these different buckets--different kinds of financial institutions, broadly defined--throughout the modern financial system. We will look at hedge funds, insurance companies, investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, central banks, consumer banks, payday lenders, state-sponsored enterprises (like the Export-Import Bank in the United States and much of the financial system in China), and the cutting edge of fintech, including crowd-funded lending, digital currencies, and more. In each case, students will be exposed to a series of specialized questions: Where did this institution come from? What problem is it trying to solve that other alternatives could not resolve? What is the basic business (or, where relevant, regulatory) model for each institution? How is each institution regulated, and by whom? What are the ethical considerations in each context? What are the political considerations that each market participant faces?",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=LGST2430,University of Pennsylvania

Blockchain is the foundation for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, as well as for distributed ledger platforms used by enterprise consortia in various industries. Many believe that blockchain solutions have revolutionary potential. They promise to replace legal enforcement with technical mechanisms of cryptographic consensus as the means of generating trust. The technology has generated significant excitement, investment, and entrepreneurial activity in recent years. However, the business value of blockchain-based solutions is uncertain, cryptocurrency valuations are speculative, and there are serious legal, regulatory, and governance challenges to be addressed.

Important questions we will address include: (1) What can we learn about leadership from being in “the environment” or “the field” that we cannot as easily learn in other settings? (2) What does it mean to be a leader in the area of climate change and environmental management at a for-profit business firm? A non-profit organization? A social enterprise/benefit corporation? Within this overarching theme of environmental and climate leadership, the course examines a concrete set of timely topics through readings, discussions, guest speakers, and written assignments, including: environmental management and a circular economy; product stewardship; extended producer responsibility; environmental personhood; greenwashing; and the different types of firms and organizations in this space, including for-profit corporations, benefit corporations/social enterprises; and non-profits. The course begins with six classroom sessions on these issues with assignments and readings run and graded by Professor Light.

FNCE2020,Con Fin Decision Making,"Research shows that many individuals are profoundly underinformed about important financial facts and financial products, which frequently lead them to make mistakes and lose money. Moreover, consumer finance comprises an enormous sector of the economy, including products like credit cards, student loans, mortgages, retail banking, insurance, and a wide variety of retirement savings vehicles and investment alternatives. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the FinTech arena are integrating innovative approaches to help consumers. Though virtually all people use these products, many find financial decisions to be confusing and complex, rendering them susceptible to fraud and deception. As a result, government regulation plays a major role in these markets. This course intended for Penn undergraduates considers economic models of household decisions and examines evidence on how consumers are managing (and mismanaging) their finances. Although academic research has historically placed more attention on corporate finance, household finance is receiving a brighter spotlight now-- partly due to its role in the recent financial crisis. Thus the course is geared toward those seeking to take charge of their own financial futures, anyone interested in policy debates over consumer financial decision making, and future FinTech entrepreneurs.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=FNCE2020,University of Pennsylvania

Financial derivatives serve as building blocks to understand broad classes of financial problems, such as complex asset portfolios, strategic corporate decisions, and stages in venture capital investing. The main objective of this course is build intuition and skills on (1) pricing and hedging of derivative securities, and (2) using them for investment and risk management. In terms of methodologies, we apply the non-arbitrage principle and the law of one price to dynamic models through three different approaches: the binomial tree model, the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, and the simulation-based risk neutral pricing approach. The course covers a wide range of applications, including the use of derivatives in asset management, the valuation of corporate securities such as stocks and corporate bonds with embedded options, interest rate and credit derivatives, as well as crude oil derivatives. We emphasize practical considerations of implementing strategies using derivatives as tools, especially when no-arbitrage conditions do not hold.

Quantitative models play a key role in the valuation and risk management of these securities. As a result, although every effort will be made to introduce the various pricing models and techniques as intuitively as possible and the technical requirements are limited to basic calculus and statistics, the class is by its nature quantitative and will require a steady amount of work. In addition, some computer proficiency will be required for the assignments, although familiarity with a spreadsheet program (such as Microsoft Excel) will suffice.

FNCE2390,Behavioral Finance,"This course combines insights from behavioral economics and psychology to shed light on anomalous decisions by investors and possibly behavior of asset prices. Its content is designed to both complement and challenge the ""rational"" investment paradigms developed in the early finance classes. It introduces students to much modern theoretical and empirical research showing this paradigm to be insufficient to describe various features of actual financial markets. The course structure involves early lectures, several cases, and a final project involving ""real life"" examples and some modern research methods. In the capstone project students research and explore a specific behavioral bias or a profitable investment opportunity. Students will work in groups to simulate the behavior of, say: a portfolio management team looking for a new trading strategy; a consulting firm advising corporations on issues of financial management; or an entrepreneurial start-up developing a retail financial product. The main deliverable is in a form of a ""pitch"" to potential clients to be delivered both in the form of a group presentation in class and a formal write-up to be submitted by the due date.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=FNCE2390,University of Pennsylvania

The core of the course connects between the legal and actual goals that central banks follow and the related economic analysis on which these goals and policies are set. We explain the economic rationale for the policy prescriptions to reach the goals and how these policies are actually implemented by the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) in the US, the European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of Israel (BOI) and some remarks on other countries. We use data, current events of the 2007-2018 period as the basis for discussion and assignments. All of these are aimed understanding how and why the Fed, the ECB and the BOI set their policies.

FNCE2910, Corporate Restructuring,"This course explores the highly active and sophisticated deal making environment that is the hallmark of modern corporate restructuring. The course is primarily comprised of two key components. The first is groundwork-laying lectures that focus on fundamental rights and obligations of debtors, creditors, and other parties in interest in the various types of major chapter 11 cases, providing critical insight into understanding the motivations, strategies, and available tools for chapter 11 participants (which also serve as the foundation for out-of-court deals). The second element of the course is a series of case study panels based on market trends from the previous year that bring together key participants from recent deals, including the CEO or chairman of the company, the judge, the lead banker and lead lawyer, and the lead investors to give their insight and perspectives to the class.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=FNCE2910,University of Pennsylvania
FNCE2970,Taxes and Bus Strategy,"The objective of this course is to develop a framework for understanding how taxes affect business decisions. The key themes of the framework - all parties, all taxes and all costs - are applied to decision contexts such as investments, compensation, organizational form, and mergers and acquisitions. The ultimate goal is to provide a new approach to thinking about taxes that will be valuable even as laws and governments change. If ACCT 2970 is not offered in a given year, Undergraduate students interested in ACCT 2970 will need to submit a permission through Path@Penn.edu. All prerequisites need to be completed in order to receive a permit. Also this class will follow the MBA calendar.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=FNCE2970,University of Pennsylvania
FNCE3110,Infrastructure Investing,"Infrastructure covers roads and bridges (the original infrastructure), to railroads, airports (the more recent infrastructure), to telecommunications and solar and wind power installations (modern infrastructure). There is a vast amount of public (taxpayer) and private (typically private equity or banks) money directed into infrastructure investments. This course covers infrastructure financing and investing from various angles. We will provide descriptions of types of infrastructure, examine the financing needs of different infrastructure projects, consider the historic role of public and private funding, assess the changing needs of consumers, role of technology and the increasing demands posed by a globalizing economy. We will also examine infrastructure investing as a alternative asset class from the investors' perspective. FNCE 2030 or FNCE 2070 are recommended.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=FNCE3110,University of Pennsylvania
FNCE3510,Finance and Society,"This interdisciplinary course delves into the history of different economic and financial systems around the world. Students will analyze the economic and financial interactions between individuals, financial and non-financial corporations, governments, and the media under various systems and through the pre-modern, modern and postmodern eras. After theoretically exploring each system and their underlying philosophy, students critically evaluate them through data-driven analysis. In the process, the course offers students a rigorous introduction to the scientific method and its enlightenment origins, as well as the resulting empirical tools used in the social sciences. The course will be intellectually rigorous but not overly mathematical.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=FNCE3510,University of Pennsylvania

It will look at the legal foundations and structures of hedge funds including the primary regulations in the U.S. and abroad that are most relevant for hedge funds. It will also present the major hedge fund strategies, describe operation, control, administration, due diligence and valuation issues. Performance evaluation and investing in hedge funds from the investor's perspective will be discussed as will be issues of potential changes in regulation, risk management, and the use of leverage. The format of the course will mix lectures with presentations from industry participants, hedge fund managers, those who invest in hedge funds, those who advise them and provide services to them, and those who regulate them. Those who want to launch a hedge fund, join an existing one, invest in one, or provide services to one will want to register for this course.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=FNCE3860,University of Pennsylvania
FNCE3920,Financial Engineering ,"This course expands the key insights from the prior quantitative finance classes such as Derivatives and Fixed Income by using more advanced tools in statistics and applied mathematics. Its focus is on devising new and innovative financial products, often employing financial derivatives and related dynamic strategies, to address portfolio and risk-management problems. The course structure involves an introductory lectures and case discussions in the first half, and a capstone ""real life"" group project where students will seek to address specific problems in finance faced by sell-side banks, and buy-side corporate clients or investment funds. Each project will focus on practical economic needs and standard activities of a specific client and/or bank and the use of derivatives and dynamic strategies to solve them. Programming skills and an exposure to numerical methods are an important part of the project in this course.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=FNCE3920,University of Pennsylvania

FNCE4010 ,Advanced Topics in PE,"This course will cover a variety of applied topics in private equity (PE) with a focus on growth and later-stage buyout transactions. It will have a primarily U.S.-centric view that is largely applicable to other markets. Venture capital is not explicitly addressed in this course. Course topics will address the entirety of the deal process and value creation in the post-acquisition period, and will include the following: - LBO modeling - Commercial due diligence (principles and execution) - Debt financing - Sale & purchase agreements (SPA) - Accounting diligence - Deal structuring - Operations & Value creation Throughout the course, students will learn about each element of the deal process through in-class lectures, while concurrently applying those learnings to former transactions (these must be old enough that sharing material is no longer sensitive). The in-class lectures will cover conceptual frameworks, practical considerations and real-world case studies and examples. There will be four assignments in this course. The first three assignments will apply these learnings to the art of the deal through a real world lens. In the last assignment, students will develop a value creation plan for designated public companies ""TargetCo1"" and ""TargetCo2"". Students are expected to actively engage in classroom discussions, challenging one another and the instructors about how to think through these issues in an ever-evolving investment world. In addition, throughout the course, students are expected to work as a team on the assignments.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=FNCE4010,University of Pennsylvania
FNCE4020,Shareholder Activism,The aim of the course is to provide an introduction to shareholder activism. The course makes use of lectures and case studies. The lectures expose the students to the institutional and empirical facts as well as approaches followed by leading shareholder activists. The case studies are designed to provide students an experience on identifying potential opportunity for value creation through active engagement. Assignments require students to develop/practice skills on fundamental analysis. Completion of either FNCE 2030 or FNCE 2070 is recommended.,https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=FNCE4020,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP0001,Intro Behavioral Economics,Governments and firms set policy in a world of behavioral agents. This course will present economic approaches to these policy problems when individuals act in behavioral ways. Readings will be newspaper articles that will be discussed in class. Assignments -- two problem sets and an exam -- will include qualitative and quantitative analysis.,https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP0001,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP1000 ,Introductory Economics,"Microeconomics is the study of the behavior of households and firms, whose collective decisions determine how resources are allocated in a free market economy. We will study when markets are likely to produce ""efficient"" outcomes, and when government intervention may improve on or harm the competitive market outcome. We will use economic theory to analyze issues like a gas tax to change reliance on oil, minimum wages to increase salaries of the working poor, and government subsidies to increase education. Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. We will understand how the size of the US economy is determined, how unemployment is measured, how inflation affects life. We will look at policy options that the government and the Federal Reserve Bank face, and discuss pros and cons of their actions. Economic arguments are often used in debates about government policies, discussion of business strategies, and many of life's other arenas. The goal of the course is to teach you to ""think like an economist,"" which I hope will help you to understand the world around you, make better economic decisions in your own life, and be a more informed citizen and voter.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP1000,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2010 ,Public Finance & Policy,"This course explores the economics and politics of public policy to provide an analytic framework for considering why, how, and with what success/failure government intervenes in a variety of policy areas. Particular attention will be paid to important policy issues relating to taxation, social security, low-income assistance, health insurance, education (both K-12 and higher ed), the environment, and government deficits. The costs and benefits of alternative policies will be explored along with the distribution of responsibilities between the federal, state and local governments. While the course will focus primarily on U.S. policies, the topics covered (e.g. tax reform, deficits versus austerity, etc.) are currently at the center of the policy debate in many other industrialized countries as well.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2010,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2020 ,Con Fin Decision Making,"Research shows that many individuals are profoundly underinformed about important financial facts and financial products, which frequently lead them to make mistakes and lose money. Moreover, consumer finance comprises an enormous sector of the economy, including products like credit cards, student loans, mortgages, retail banking, insurance, and a wide variety of retirement savings vehicles and investment alternatives. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the FinTech arena are integrating innovative approaches to help consumers. Though virtually all people use these products, many find financial decisions to be confusing and complex, rendering them susceptible to fraud and deception. As a result, government regulation plays a major role in these markets. This course intended for Penn undergraduates considers economic models of household decisions and examines evidence on how consumers are managing (and mismanaging) their finances. Although academic research has historically placed more attention on corporate finance, household finance is receiving a brighter spotlight now-- partly due to its role in the recent financial crisis. Thus the course is geared toward those seeking to take charge of their own financial futures, anyone interested in policy debates over consumer financial decision making, and future FinTech entrepreneurs.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2020,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2030 ,Bus in Global Pol Envir,"This course examines the non-market components of business and the broader political, regulatory, and civil context in which companies function. This course addresses how businesses interact with political and regulatory institutions, as well as the general public, with a focus on the global economy. The first portion examines the realities associated with political economy and the actual making of laws and regulations by imperfect politicians and regulators. The second portion analyzes the economic rationale for legislation and regulation in the presence of market failures. The course covers specific market failures and potential solutions including government regulation.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2030,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2080 ,Housing Markets,"This course is designed for students interested in the economics and operations of housing markets. It is primarily a U.S. focused course, but does include a limited amount of international material for comparative purposes. The class is divided into four sections: (1) supply and demand for housing, including the operations of homebuilders and rental landlords; (2) house prices, including cycles and price dynamics; (3) international comparisons; and (4) public policy analysis applied to a current housing markets-related issue. This course presumes knowledge of intermediate economics, as we will apply that knowledge throughout the semester. For Wharton students, this means you must have passed BEPP 2500 (undergrads) or MGEC 61100and 6120 for MBA's. Non-Wharton students should have taken the equivalent course in the College. Lecture with discussion required.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2080,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2110 ,Tax Policy & Practice,"The academic component of the course will focus on several areas: (1) The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap. Students will read this book throughout the semester to support their understanding of the community that they will be serving. (2) Statutory tax system. Students will learn about the tax system as it relates to individuals and sole proprietors. The VITA training covers general tax preparation, with a specific focus on tax credits available to VITA-eligible taxpayers and the use of VITA software. In addition, one session of the course will include a guest lecture/discussion. It will focus on statutory tax issues related to organizational form choice for self-employed and gig economy workers, which is an important statutory issue in low-income communities. (3) Social policy debate. Tax policy, including deductions, subsidies and credits, are one tool that lawmakers can use to get more cash in the hands of individuals and families, especially for low-income groups. Students will consider the effectiveness and usefulness of tax policies relative to other tools that the government has available. There are three guest lecturers for the sessions on tax policy. (4) Working with people. Volunteering with VITA requires students to work with people from a low-income community on the sensitive issue of personal finances. Students will learn to discuss sensitive financial issues with lower-income adults (including many seniors) through readings and in-class discussions, and by reflecting on their real-life experiences in the local community. This skill is important in a variety of roles such as healthcare (physicians and nurses), business (e.g., the HR function), and education. The community service part of the course is volunteering with VITA, which is the IRS’s “Volunteer Income Tax Assistance” program. Following training, students will perform tax services for the West Philadelphia community during the tax season. The course will meet once a week in three-hour sessions for 8-9 weeks during the Spring semester. Students are expected to be in the field performing service throughout a significant portion of the semester. As described on the IRS website, the VITA program has operated for over 50 years. Volunteers offer free tax help to people who need assistance in preparing their own tax returns, including: • People who generally make $58,000 or less • Persons with disabilities; and • Limited English-speaking taxpayers.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2110,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2120 ,Economic Analysis of Law,"This course provides an introduction to the economic analysis of law and legal institutions. Our goal is develop intuitions about the ways law simultaneously shapes and responds to private behavioral incentives. In the first half of the course, we will survey the application of key economic concepts to basic features of the Anglo-American common law of property, contract, and tort. In the second half of the course, we will use the tools developed in our survey to focus in depth on the law of intellectual property.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2120,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2140 ,Nonprofit Sector: Econom,"The nonprofit sector plays a key role in the provision of many goods and services which are fundamental in our society and which may be difficult to provide using market mechanisms alone. Education, health care, charitable services, and the arts are some primary examples of these. Nonprofit organizations operate in service of specific social missions rather than profit maximization, but in order to serve those missions effectively while ensuring their own survival, they must also make many of the decisions typically associated with private firms. That is, they must compete for funding, human resources, and consumers of their services, they must manage and invest their resources efficiently, and they must innovate new products and services over time. Importantly, the latter requirements may at times come in conflict with the organizations' social values. As a result, nonprofit organizations as economic decision-makers confront a number of unique challenges to their success and growth. The goal of this course is to give students a broad overview of the economic, organizational, and strategic concerns facing the non-profit sector. Our objective is to characterize the unique economic environment, identify effective strategic governance, and management approaches, and explore how appropriate measurement techniques can can inform the policy treatment of nonprofits. This course is organized around a number of lectures, readings and outside speakers, a midterm exam and a required project.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2140,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2200 ,Behavioral Economics,"Behavioral economics has revealed a variety of systematic ways in which people deviate from being perfectly selfish, rational, optimizing agents. These findings have important implications for government policy and firm behavior. This course will explore these implications by answering two main questions: (1) what does behavorial economics imply for when and how the government should intervene in markets? (2) What does behavioral economics imply for firms' pricing and production decisions? The course will present the standard economic approaches to answering these questions and then explore how answers change when we consider that people act in behavioral ways. Towards the end of the course, we will investigate specific policy questions, allowing us to debate solutions while hearing from policy makers operating in a world of behavioral agents.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2200,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2300 ,Urban Fiscal Policy,"This course will examine the provision of public services for firms and people through cities. Why cities exist, when fiscal policy fails, investments in infrastructure, realities of local governments such as inequality, crime, corruption, high cost of living, congestion, and unfunded pensions and debt, will be covered. We will pay special attention to recent topics, such as partnerships with the private sector, enterprise zones, the role of technology, environmental challenges, and real estate policies that promote housing affordability, such as rent control and inclusionary zoning.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2300,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2330 ,"Consumers,Firms & Market","Nearly four-fifths of the world's population lives in low income or developing countries. Though currently far behind the U.S., the 15 fastest growing economies/markets in the world are all developing countries. And developing countries already account for 6 of the world's 15 largest economies. This course will examine economic life, including consumers, firms and markets, in low income countries. We will apply both economic theory and empirical analysis for analyzing the roles of both business and government in consumption, production and market equilibria.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2330,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2360 ,Int'l Housing Comparisns,"This course analyzes housing finance systems and housing market outcomes across the globe. In the US, the course focuses on the development of securitization markets and addresses the current challenges of housing finance reform, including the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Internationally, the course covers issues of access to housing and housing informality in developing countries, financial crises arising out of the housing sector, and market-oriented and public policy solutions. The course features a wide array of speakers in finance, government and academia who contribute their perspectives to pressing issues of mortgage market design.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2360,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2500 ,Managerial Economics,"This course will introduce you to ""managerial economics"" which is the application of microeconomic theory to managerial decision-making. Microeconomic theory is a remarkably useful body of ideas for understanding and analyzing the behavior of individuals and firms in a variety of economic settings. The goal of the course is for you to understand this body of theory well enough so that you can effectively analyze managerial (and other) problems in an economic framework. While this is a ""tools"" course, we will cover many real-world applications, particularly business applications, so that you can witness the usefulness of these tools and acquire the skills to use them yourself. We will depart from the usual microeconomic theory course by giving more emphasis to prescription: What should a manager do in order to achieve some objective? That course deliverable is to compare with description: Why do firms and consumers act the way they do? The latter will still be quite prominent in this course because only by understanding how other firms and customers behave can a manager determine what is beswt for him or her to do. Strategic interaction is explored both in product markets and auctions. Finally, the challenges created by asymmetric information - both in the market and within the firm - are investigated.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2500,University of Pennsylvania

BEPP2610 ,Risk Analy & Env Mgmt,"This course will introduce students to concepts in risk governance. We will delve into the three pillars of risk analysis: risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. The course will spend time on risk financing, including insurance markets. There will be particular emphasis on climate risks, although the course will also discuss several other examples, including pandemics, biodiversity loss, and systemic risks, among others. The course will cover how people perceive risks and the impact this has on risk communication and management. We will explore public policy surrounding risk management and how the public and private sectors can successfully work together to build resilience, particularly to changing risks.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2610,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2630 ,Environ. & Energy Econ,"This course examines environmental and energy issues from an economist's perspective. Over the last several decades, energy markets have become some of the most dynamic markets of the world economy, as they experienced a shift from heavy regulation to market-driven incentives. First, we look at scarcity pricing and market power in electricity and gasoline markets. We then study oil and gas markets, with an emphasis on optimal extraction and pricing, and geopolitical risks that investors in hydrocarbon resources face. We then shift gears to the sources of environmental problems, and how policy makers can intervene to solve some of these problems. We talk about the economic rationale for a broad range of possible policies: environmental taxes, subsidies, performance standards and cap-and-trade. In doing so, we discuss fundamental concepts in environmental economics, such as externalities, valuation of the environment and the challenge of designing international agreements. At the end of the course, there will be special attention for the economics and finance of renewable energy and policies to foster its growth. Finally, we discuss the transportation sector, and analyze heavily debated policies such as fuel-economy standards and subsidies for green vehicles. Prerequisites: An introductory microeconomics course (ECON1, or another course approved by the instructor) will be sufficient in most cases; BEPP 250 or an equivalent intermediate microeconomics course is recommended.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2630,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2640 ,Climate and Financial Markets,"Climate change might be the defining challenge of our times, with a wide range of effects on financial markets and the broader economy. At the same time, financial markets play an important role in financing the transition to a net-zero economy. This role, however, is shaped by the information that is available to market participants. In this course, we examine how climate risks—both physical and regulatory—affect firms, financial markets (including carbon and renewable-energy certificate markets), and markets for energy and real estate. We examine the role that firms’ disclosures and third-party information sources play. As climate change is high on the agenda of almost every company and government, this course will be valuable both for students with the ambition to pursue a career centered around sustainability and those who want to gain a better understanding of how climate issues affect more traditional roles in the financial sector, consulting, or non-profits. The starting point for this course is that financial market participants increasingly realize that climate change represents an important investment risk. One central concern focuses on transition risks, and in particular on the effects that regulatory responses to climate change have on the business models of carbon-intensive energy companies. We discuss how concerns about various climate risks influence the way investors allocate their capital and exercise their oversight of firms. We start with the price impacts of climate risks in equity, debt and real estate markets, including the role played by shareholder activism and engagement, divestment and portfolio alignment. Next, we study carbon markets with a focus on pricing and discuss strategies to hedge climate risks through financial instruments such as carbon or renewable-energy credits and derivative contracts. We then explore how different firms in the global energy sector—ranging from oil & gas to renewable energy to electric utilities—have responded to climate-related pressures from their investors and other stakeholders. Because outsiders’ reactions depend on the information that they have, we investigate the impact of ESG reporting on financial markets and on the choices that managers make. Here, we also discuss the costs and benefits of regulating ESG reporting and the impact of greenwashing. We pay special attention to the impact of climate risk and reporting on decisions inside organizations, such as spin-offs, hedging, catastrophe insurance, and the structure of executive-compensation contracts. Further topics include life-cycle emissions and the social cost of carbon.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2640,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2650 ,Economics of Diversity ,"This class will cover the economics of gender, race, and discrimination guided by economic theory and empirical evidence. Topics on gender will include workplace discrimination, policies to promote gender equality, the historical evolution of economic gender roles in the US, and initiatives to promote women's empowerment in developing countries. Topics on race will include an overview of historical economic exclusion and its consequences, the empirical measurement of discrimination, models of discrimination and their shortcomings, and how understanding hidden biases and historical barriers can increase firms' equity and performance. This course is complementary with MGMT 2240/MGMT6240, and material will not overlap, so students especially interested in diversity issues should seek to take both courses. While MGMT 2240/MGMT 6240 focuses on evidence-based solutions for managing diversity, this course focuses on the economic science of race, gender, and discrimination: How do economists model bias? What does empirical evidence say about the benefits of diversity, and the harms of discrimination? How do we measure whether discrimination is still taking place, despite a growing awareness of diversity and inclusion? What is unique about women as economic agents, and how do we understand gender equality in the workplace in light of this? This class will equip students with economics models and empirical evidence that can serve as a toolkit to analyze both policy and business decisions.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2650,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2800 ,Applied Data Analysis,"This course will examine how and when data can be used specifically to infer whether there is a causal relationship between two variables. We will emphasize (a) the critical role of an underlying economic theory of behavior in interpreting data and guiding analysis, as well as (b) a range of advanced techniques for inferring causality from data, such as randomized controlled trials, regression discontinuity, difference-in-difference, audit study (mystery shopping) approaches and stock-market event studies. The issue of causality, and the relevance of thinking about models and methods for inferring causality, is just as central and important for ""Big Data"" as it is when working with traditional data sets in business and public policy. The emphasis will not be on proofs and derivations but rather on understanding the underlying concepts, the practical use, implications and limitations of techniques. Students will work intensively with data, drawing from examples in business and public policy, to develop the skills to use data analysis to make better decisions. All analysis will be conducted using R. The goals of the course are for students to become expert consumers able to interpret and evaluate empirical studies as well as expert producers of convincing empirical analysis themselves.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2800,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2840 ,Game Thy For Bus & Life,"The objective of this course is to make you more skilled in strategic reasoning. Strategic situations permeate our lives and we will examine many such situations through the lens of game theory. The course is composed of game-theoretic concepts, applications, and experiential learning. The bulk of the applications are to business situations including product entry, bargaining, managerial incentive contracts, and network effects. Given the ubiquitous presence of strategic situations in human societies, applications will also extend to politics, war, sports, history, crime, theology, and every day life, and cover such topics as steroid use in sports, traffic congestion, corruption, racial discrimination, and sexual harassment. Students will regularly participate in experiments involving strategic reasoning, and form teams to compete in a simulated industry environment.",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2840,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP2890 ,Economic Globalization,"This course is intended to deepen understanding of the major contemporary issues in the world economy. The focus is on the ""big picture"" of global economic developments and the evolution of economic thought over the last one hundred years. The topics include: financial market booms and busts; business cycles; monetary and fiscal policies; inequality; the social welfare state; technological change and economic growth; and international trade and financial arrangements. The time period covers: the Roaring Twenties; the Great Depression, the post war Golden Age (1945-1973); the stagflation of the 1970s; the Washington Consensus era of the market liberalization (1980-2007); and the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007-2010 and its aftermath. The course also explores different schools of thought. The course will chronicle and compare economic policy and performance of the United States, Europe, Japan and emerging markets (Asia, Latin America, Africa).",https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=BEPP2890,University of Pennsylvania
BEPP3050 ,Risk Management ,"The last financial crisis and subsequent recession provide ample evidence that failure to properly manage risk can result in disaster. Individuals and firms confront risk in nearly all decisions they make. People face uncertainty in their choice of careers, spending and saving decisions, family choices and many other facets of life. Similarly, the value that firms create by designing and marketing good products is at risk from a variety of sources. The bankruptcy of a key supplier, sharp rise in cost of financing, destruction of an important asset, impact of global warming, or a liability suit can quickly squander the value created by firms. In extreme cases, risky outcomes can bankrupt a firm, as has happened recently to manufacturers of automobile parts and a variety of financial service firms. The events since the Global Financial Crisis also offer stark reminders that risk can impose significant6 costs on individuals, firms, governments, and society as a whole.

ECON 70,Personal Finance: Making Better Decisions and Building a Better Financial System,"People face a daunting array of problems in managing their financial lives.  Taking out student loans, managing bank accounts and credit cards, financing a home purchase with a mortgage, and saving for retirement are all major challenges.  There is evidence that many people lack the skills they need to meet these challenges.  This course has three goals.  The first objective is to give participants a basic grounding in financial literacy: principles of finance that we can use in our own lives.  The second objective is to introduce research on the ways in which households use the financial system, emphasizing common financial mistakes and financial products that seem prone to misuse.  We will learn to read papers from the academic economics literature, focusing on the papers’ central ideas and empirical findings.  The third objective is to explore ways in which the financial system can be improved to make it easier and safer to use.  We will discuss the role of financial advisers, technological solutions (“fintech”), and public policy interventions including disclosures, default choices (“nudges”), and regulations restricting access to financial products.

GENED 1167,Climate Crossroads,"Irreversible climate change poses an unprecedented challenge to the stability of all societies:  what are the scientifically viable pathways to a future that is sustainable and just? What one thing is changing everything in your lifetime—and for generations to come? It’s changing what you eat; it’s changing buildings you live in; and it’s changing politics, the arts, and finance. The change is accelerating. This course reveals fundamental alterations that climate disruption is bringing to multiple human activities and natural phenomena. The course represents a crossroads in two senses. First, it’s a crossroads of disciplines. Climate change affects science, society, culture, government policy, biodiversity, and environmental justice. To understand it is inherently interdisciplinary and requires standing at the crossroads of several approaches. Second, humanity itself is at a new crossroads. Because global climate is shifting rapidly, this prompts new views of humans in geologic time, as well as new thinking in economics, law, finance, and science.Climate change isn’t just “global warming.” It’s an alteration of conditions on Earth to which all creatures and societies are adjusting. What is the science of climate change? Why can’t understanding and dealing with climate change be confined to science? Through materials and assignments that address quantitative understanding and qualitative judgment, you’ll learn why it’s unwise to seal the interrelated issues of climate change in separate disciplines; conversely, why it’s necessary to use separate disciplines to acquire the knowledge and applications needed to formulate policy and actions. You’ll learn about climate adaptation (adjusting to changing climate), mitigation (reducing the speed and severity of climate change), and resilience (e.g., recovering from extremeweather events). You’ll discover how careers in many different areas increasingly involve thinking about climate.",https://syllabus.harvard.edu/?course_id=215873,Harvard College
SOC-STD 98VE,"Empire, Capitalism, and Global Economic Development","This course introduces students to the historical study of the world economy by tracing the emergence of a global capitalist economy from the early modern period to the present. It looks at how capitalism first emerged, how it expanded globally, and how it has been transformed over the last six centuries. It does so by looking at the history of international trade, finance and banking, labor and slavery, industrialization, and agriculture. It considers how global capitalism developed in response to transformations in the balance of power between rival empires and nations. It also focuses on the history of global economic inequality -- and its persistence today.

What is the right balance between national sovereignty and international integration? Is the US equipped to sustain its role as a global leader? How does international trade affect prosperity and inequality? Should we regulate multi-national companies who move their factories to countries with lower labor standards? How should the IMF respond to financial crises in Europe and the developing world? How will the rise of China change the world system? This course uses basic economic logic to illuminate the choices - and trade-offs - faced by governments, international institutions, businesses, and citizens as the global economy evolves.

Marketing helps create value for consumers and extract a share of that value for the organization. We will spend time understanding the fundamentals of marketing management and examine how recent economic, technological, cultural, and societal developments have affected the marketing field. We will first cover the central themes of customer behavior, strategic marketing analysis, innovation forecasting, and brand management. Then we will explore how marketing has dramatically evolved in recent years due to: the digital and social-media revolution; the increasing shift from human-based to technology-based interactions with customers; firms’ desire to globalize; societal trends affecting consumer preferences; and the call for companies to exhibit greater social responsibility. In examining these themes, we will also draw upon research from the domains of psychology, sociology and economics. Each session will have assigned pre-readings that may include case studies, book chapters, and articles. The discussion and material covered in class will rely upon these readings. During the term each student will identify a marketing phenomenon they find intriguing and that reflects concepts covered in class.

The demand for therapy is currently at an all-time high, bolstering its century-long dominance as the preferred antidote to human unhappiness and misery, even as it is under sustained attack from critics characterizing it as self-indulgent as well as from platforms that would replace human therapists with chatbots and analysts with algorithms. This course explores the conflicts and controversies that characterize today’s psychotherapeutic landscape, addressing questions concerning its present condition and future prospects. We will look at the development, methods, aims, efficacy, and limitations of a range of psychotherapeutic modalities—among them psychoanalytic, psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, manualized, evidence-based, and AI-informed treatments as well as family, sex, and group therapies—and explore how each took shape, who it is intended to treat, and how clinicians evaluate its effectiveness. We will examine therapy’s long-overdue, on-going reckoning with racial issues, gendered identities, and access to treatment. We will explore the various modern selves envisioned by psychotherapy, from the highly relational to the independently sovereign. You will leave the course prepared to recognize and evaluate claims regarding therapy’s rationale and impact in a range of sites, from the clinician’s office to the modern workplace to the media, as well as to assess the ways in which happiness, contentment, and satisfaction in life are subject—or not—to therapeutic intervention.

ENGLISH 90RI,Race in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,"Who gets to count as human? This ostensibly simple question has been complicated anew in the 20th and 21st centuries by a series of historical events and cultural representations that have racialized people of color as robots, unfeeling machines, and other synthetic forms of life. In this seminar, we will explore the fractured, queer affinities between race and artificial intelligence by considering, on the one hand, how racialized subjects have been stigmatized or oppressed through comparisons with machinic forms of life and, on the other hand, how AI has become a productive means for people of color to envision new modes of expressing emotions, sustaining communities, and challenging racism. Throughout, we will examine a wide range of literary genres—including poetry, fiction, memoir, and comics—as well as a selection of sci-fi films and new media artworks. Our explorations will start well before the digital age, in the year 1946, as we look to the graphic memoir Citizen 13660 by Miné Okubo, which documents the daily life of Japanese internment camps and serves as an early inquiry into the racialization of Asian Americans as mechanized laborers and clones. We will conclude with Stephanie Dinkins’ artworks Conversations with Bina48 and Not the Only One, which over seventy-five years later explore how Black cultural practices, community formations, and storytelling methods can resist and re-code the exclusionary histories of artificial intelligence systems. For the final project, students will have the option to produce an AI prototype oriented towards racial justice (no prior technical knowledge required).",https://syllabus.harvard.edu/?course_id=222129,Harvard College

What challenges do we face as people of different communities encounter one another in cities and public institutions, schools and businesses, neighborhoods and families? These are urgent questions in many nations today, but in this course we focus on the United States. We explore, discuss, and analyze the changing multi-cultural and multi-religious landscape of America with an eye to the growing Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, and Sikh communities in the most recent period of post-1965 immigration. In what contexts do these and other minority communities encounter America’s secularism, its commitment to religious freedom, and its long-dominant Christian and Jewish communities? Our approach will be through the study and in-class discussion of case-studies enabling you to enter into some of the controversies and dilemmas that confront schools, universities, town councils, zoning boards, and places of work. You will be challenged to take the perspective of mayors and concerned citizens, teachers and executives, religious and civic leaders –all confronting the choices and changes of a dynamic society.

They can draw upon history, statistics, psychology, and philosophy. They can be reported or ruminative, formally experimental or straightforward, richly descriptive or tense and spare. They can be fun. Over the course of the semester, students will read and discuss exemplary profiles, essays, articles, and blog posts, while also writing and discussing their own. While much (but not all) of the reading will come from the world of sports, no interest in or knowledge about sports is required; our focus will be on writing for a broad audience.

SOC-STD 98VG,"Capitalism, Subjectivity, and the ""Entrepreneurial Self""","This class takes a psychosocial approach to understanding the relationship between capitalism and contemporary subjectivity. In particular it looks at how core entrepreneurial practices and values (e.g., managed risk, competition, flexibility) are taken up outside of business schools as individuals in all walks of life are increasingly compelled to treat themselves as an enterprise or brand. Among the questions we will ask: How and when did the compulsion towards self-branding come to be and what are its psychological and sociological effects? How do these practices shape people’s experiences of themselves, others, and future possibilities? Does the contemporary ""entrepreneurial” self express itself differently in other cultures? To address these questions, we begin with anthropological and historical examples of a variety of ways personhood has been constituted. We then trace the genealogy of the “self"" against the backdrop of capitalism’s transformation, exploring the contradictory forms of liberation and domination that accompany entrepreneurial self-making. Specific case studies will include therapy, self-help, social entrepreneurialism, education, technology, and volunteerism. This theory intensive class draws from a range of disciplines while introducing students to the key methods of sociocultural anthropology. This is a junior tutorial.

FYSEMR 40K,America's $4 Trillion Challenge: Boosting Health Care Productivity and Broadening Access,"“Why does health care cost so much, and why aren’t Americans healthier?” Policymakers, employers, and the public share deep frustration at high health expenditures, which are blamed for rising federal deficits, the declining competitiveness of US businesses, and the risk of financial ruin for anyone unfortunate enough to suffer a costly illness or injury. Unless health expenditures can be controlled, universal access to care will remain an unattainable goal. Since it began in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has raised additional questions about the cost and effectiveness of both medical care and the public health system in the U.S.In this seminar, we will explore the causes and consequences of the high costs of health care and a range of approaches to increasing the productivity of public health and medical care. We will examine these issues in part through the lens of health reform, emphasizing the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) as well reactions to the Act, such as proposals for its modification or repeal. Students will be exposed to techniques for measuring the effectiveness and value of health care and will become familiar with economic and clinical studies. Course requirements include a mid-term outline and final paper on either micro or macro solutions for improving health care productivity in the US.",https://syllabus.harvard.edu/?course_id=109334,Harvard College
B3013 ,Financial Accounting,"Financial statements are meant to enable the reader to evaluate the performance of an enterprise, analyze its cash flows and assess its financial position. Recently, widely publicized cases of misleading statements, which were nevertheless attested as to their fairness by outside auditors, resulted in improper revenue recognition, overstatement of income and misrepresentation of financial position. There is now a growing awareness of the importance of honest reporting as the foundation for investors’ confidence in the integrity and proper functioning of the financial markets. This course examines the generally accepted accounting principles [GAAP] underlying the financial statements, their implementation in practice and the role of the independent auditors. Note is also made of the limitations of financial reports, their evolution in response to changing business conditions, current accounting controversies and the constraints that limit the freedom and influence the course of action of rule makers and regulators. The perspective and main focus are not those of the accountants who prepare financial reports, but rather those of the users of the information contained in them: mostly investors and the financial analysts who serve them, creditors and, to some extent, management.",,Columbia University

This course identifies these critical leadership skills and provides ideas and tools for improving them. Then, the course considers how social intelligence skills fit the needs of managers at different stages of their careers. In early stages, managers need to achieve a good person-job fit, find mentors, and build an effective social network. At the mid-career stage, managers need to lead an effective unit with increasing complexity and responsibilities. Finally, the course examines challenges managers face at later career stages as they become partners, CFOs, CEOs, etc.",,Columbia University

B7008 ,Earnings Quality & Fundamental Analysis,"Financial reporting provides a window into the operational and financial workings of a company. However, translating this information into actionable insights is anything but straightforward. It requires an understanding of: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the quality of financial information, and adjustments and analyses used to assess profitability, risk, growth, and value. The course starts with a short review of financial reporting and then focuses on various modules of fundamental analysis, including earnings quality, performance evaluation, risk assessment, forecasting, and valuation. The remaining class meetings are devoted to a deeper dive into the reporting and analysis of key transactions (e.g., business combinations, leasing) and financial statement line items (e.g., revenue, income taxes). We will also cover non-GAAP/pro-forma reporting. This is a case-based class. Much of our time will be spent discussing real-world cases rather than in a lecture format. We will study many actual financial disclosures and cases of accounting abuses.

The class also incorporates insights from practitioner and academic research.",,Columbia University
B7009 ,Financial Statement Analysis and Valuation,"The purpose of this course is to learn about fundamental drivers of value and risk by analyzing financial statements of businesses in different industries. Every public company provides a lot of financial and operational information in its filings. How can this information be used to evaluate its prospects and its risks? The course is organized around two themes (1) how to identify relevant information in the financial information reported by firms, and (2) how to draw inferences using sound analytical methodology. To this end, we will review techniques for valuation and risk analysis used by banks and asset management firms. The valuation models you will study in this course are all fundamental models – models that use financial information and review the fundamental operating characteristics of the company. We will learn to build simple financial models, perform risk analysis and fine tune value drivers. Much of the data comes from the financial statements – but it requires a careful study of arcane footnotes to unearth the information provided by the companies. This is an advanced course that goes into the details of footnote analysis, accounting rules, and financial presentations. This course builds on what you learned in Financial Accounting and Corporate Finance. These courses are pre‐requisites for taking this course. It is assumed that you have already taken these courses. If you have not taken these courses you should first talk with me before you register. This course will build significantly on your knowledge from those courses. If your basics are solid and you are interested in learning to read financial statements; if you wish to learn to apply financial analysis; this course is for you. We will use excel to build some of the models – but this is not a course in excel. But, it is highly recommended that you have a good working knowledge of how to build formulas in excel before you come to this class. By the end of the course, you should be able to perform a thorough, credible investment or credit analysis that meets a high standard. Students should have the ability to estimate fundamental values, and pull apart the information in the financial statements to get relevant information.

B7514 ,Napoleon's Glance,"This elective course offers a key skill for your work and life: how to get a creative idea. Other courses teach the science of management, through analytical tools and techniques: this course teaches the art, through creative intuition - otherwise known as Napoleons glance. The term Napoleons glance"" comes from nineteenth century military theory. The first great modern general that scholars studied in detail was Napoleon Bonaparte: in his classic book, On War (1832), Carl von Clausewitz shows the key to Napoleons success as coup doeil, which means ""glance"" in French. Today we recognize coup doeil as creative intuition: ordinary intuition is just a feeling, but creative intuition comes from real knowledge and experience, brought together in a flash of insight to suit the situation. Its the ""big Aha!"" - or a series of smaller ones - that shows you the way ahead. This course helps you see how coup doeil works and how to apply it. We learn where entrepreneurs get their ideas, where innovators get their innovations, where visionaries get their vision, where creative insights come from, how leaders know where to lead to - and how you too can prepare for, recognize, and seize opportunities of all kinds. Napoleons glance is a simple idea, but its difficult to use to full advantage in specific situations. You will continue to learn it all your life: this course gives you a step along that path. You will gain insights, tools and techniques you can begin applying upon graduation - or even before, in your current job search or choice of career. Class sessions consist of lecture and discussion on key aspects of Napoleons glance, a review of cases that show it in action, and in-class exercises and videos. Case examples draw from material where the strategists intuition shines through. Pre-class readings for the first session will be on Canvas before the first session. There are two short surveys (one sentence each) about the readings to complete before the first session, also on Canvas. Requirements for the course are: do the readings, attend class, answer an online survey question before each session, and send me a ""Nightly Note.""

The course emphasizes how to work through and around these various obstacles, and thereby bring about high quality decisions.",,Columbia University
B7556 ,Global Entrepreneurship,"Global Entrepreneurship surveys the key issues in forming and operating a venture that is global in one or more important respects from a very early stage. The first part of the course will illustrate the four main models of global entrepreneurship with real life examples from the authors research, and identify the key success factors for each model. The second part of the course will focus on the practical competencies entrepreneurs need to function effectively in global settings. Students will be expected to carefully prepare and actively discuss 10-11 recent case studies (almost all of which I wrote and know intimately), as well as to submit several short written exercises. The grade will be weighted towards participation but will include the written exercises as well.""",,Columbia University
B7592 ,Immersive Teamwork,"Throughout your career, you’ll spend a substantial share of your professional time and effort as a member and/or leader of teams. This two-and-a-half day course will help you get ready to harness the potential of teams and to thrive as a team member and leader. The course relies heavily on game playing and game (re)design as avenues for understanding team dynamics. Across the course, you will not be a passive audience member or spectator, copying down someone else’s generic recipe for team success. Instead, you’ll be an active co-creator of your own individualized experience in the service of our two main course objectives: a) deepening your understanding of yourself as a team member and leader and b) building your knowledge of, and practicing behaviors related to, team dynamics and team success. Be prepared to engage in multiple forms of team activities, ranging from an intense multi-hour-long immersive simulation (a large-scale game) with coordination challenges across team roles (such as Navigator, Engineer, and Analyst) to an extended team design sprint, creating your own game modification that your team will showcase with classmates. Our learning environment will require and reward active participation, a willingness to support and engage with classmates, and a readiness to both give and receive candid, constructive feedback. Students will engage in reading and reflection both before and after our two-and-a-half days of class time. Students are urged to review the syllabus for additional details. Attendance is mandatory for the entire course.",,Columbia University
B7619 ,Behavioral Economics & Decision Making,"This course seeks to better understand how psychological variables affect economic outcomes. More specifically, we will focus on the psychological processes and biases underlying decision-making with an emphasis on how to incorporate such insights into marketing, management, and business more generally. The course has two facets: first, it gives students a broad overview of important results from the behavioral sciences (e.g., social and cognitive psychology, consumer research) that show how people really make decisions (in contrast to the rational expectations model underlying classical economic theories); second, it provides students with practical advice about applying these findings to topics in business. Topics covered include: decision models, decision heuristics and biases, risk, impatience and self-control, bounded awareness and information filtering, fairness, bounded ethicality, choice architecture and nudges. Class time will be devoted to a combination of lectures, discussion, exercises, and casework. Grading will be based on class participation, individual case write-ups, other assignments, and a final exam.",,Columbia University
B7636 ,Product Management,"Product management is a fast growing field born out of the need for a single person or small team of people within an organization to own the entirety of the end-to-end product development cycle, while also understanding and reconciling product decisions with business needs. This course focuses specifically on digital product management and is intended as a primer for those interested in a product management career or those with a general interest in how technology products are made. Those who want to play at the intersection of technology, business, and management are often well-suited for product management, a role that is often referred to as “CEO of the product” but without direct control of most of the resources required to build and launch a successful product. Product managers must be proficient in a broad range of capabilities, and must lead through influence, not authority.",,Columbia University
B7640 ,Digital Marketing,"Digital Marketing combines a high level strategic view of digital marketing and its challenges and opportunities, with a tactical approach using exercises and projects to learn and use the tools and techniques of digital marketers. From the web to mobile, email to apps, social media and user generated content, the course will develop a strategic framework for planning and analyzing digital marketing strategies. Students will leave the course with a working knowledge of the tools and processes for creating, managing, and executing digital marketing plans.",,Columbia University
B7650 ,Strategic Sales Management,"Earning sales revenues is critical to firm survival, growth, and enhancing shareholder value. Personal communication via some form of sales effort is the major way many firms persuade customers to purchase their products, especially in B2B markets. This course is designed to provide students with critical considerations in conducting and managing these selling efforts. Strategic Sales Management commences by focusing on key ideas in making sales and the sales process, then moves to consider managerial issues in sales -- managing the traditional salesforce, then transitioning to managing key/strategic accounts. We conclude the course by morphing into managing global customers. Pedagogic processes include lecture/discussion, case studies, and visitors—including Columbia MBA and EMBA alumni – seasoned professionals with significant expertise in their focus areas. Without a doubt, what we consider traditional sales management is under significant change from environmental forces. Indeed, many salesforces are undergoing major transformations. We place significant attention on salespeople/account managers, and the front-line sales manager; then move on to discuss the responsibilities of sales leaders and senior sales managers. As we transition into managing key/strategic accounts, we identify the firm’s current-and-future critical customer assets, then put in place strategy, organization, human resources, and systems/processes designed to increase revenues/profits through enhanced customer loyalty. Key/strategic accounts are critically important for the firm’s future; hence, they are worthy of top management concern. For many years, managing key/strategic accounts was confined within national borders or, at most, within a few geographically contiguous countries. Today, globalization is impacting many areas of management practice. In particular, as customer firms increasingly request global contracts and require consistent global service, many suppliers are developing global account management programs and appointing global account managers (GAMs). In this course, we address key/strategic account programs at regional (within-country), national, regional (multi-country), and global levels.",,Columbia University
